Purpose:
The purpose of the program is to run a ghost hunting simulation with four hunters and a ghost. 
Each hunter goes into different rooms of the house randomly to collect evidence left by the ghost.
The ghost acts randomly, and may leave depending on it's boredom level (which increases when it's in a room without a hunter).
The simulation ends whne the ghost gets too bored or the hunters collect three pieces of evidence.

Files:
defs.h - Contains the declarations of the structures and main functions used in the program

evidence.c - Contains functions that initialize the evidence structures, adds evidence, collects evidence, and frees memory allocated for evidence

ghost.c - Contains functions that initializes ghost and controls ghost behaviours

house.c - Contains functions that initializes the house with the rooms

hunter.c - Contains functions that initialize hunters and controls hunter behaviours

main.c - Initializes and runs the main program

Makefile - Makefile that compiles and links the required program files

logger.c - Logs the activity of the ghosts and hunters dueing the simulation

room.c - Initializes and connects the rooms

utils.c - Contains utility functions that are used across the program

README.txt

How to compile and Run:
Navigate to the directory where all the source files are located.
Type "make" into a new terminal.

After compiling, run the program by typing:
./fpains functions that initialize hunters and controls hunter behaviours
